{"prompt": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "gpiozero is a simple library written in Python as an interface to GPIO devices with Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe following is the InputDevice class from this library. You should generate property based tests for this class:\n\n```python\nimport warnings\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom threading import Event, Lock\nfrom itertools import tee\nfrom statistics import median, mean\nfrom .exc import InputDeviceError, DeviceClosed, DistanceSensorNoEcho, PinInvalidState, PWMSoftwareFallback\nfrom .devices import GPIODevice, CompositeDevice\nfrom .mixins import GPIOQueue, EventsMixin, HoldMixin, event\nclass InputDevice(GPIODevice):\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents a generic GPIO input device.\n\n    This class extends :class:`GPIODevice` to add facilities common to GPIO\n    input devices.  The constructor adds the optional *pull_up* parameter to\n    specify how the pin should be pulled by the internal resistors. The\n    :attr:`is_active` property is adjusted accordingly so that :data:`True`\n    still means active regardless of the *pull_up* setting.\n\n    :type pin: int or str\n    :param pin:\n        The GPIO pin that the device is connected to. See :ref:`pin-numbering`\n        for valid pin numbers. If this is :data:`None` a :exc:`GPIODeviceError`\n        will be raised.\n\n    :type pull_up: bool or None\n    :param pull_up:\n        If :data:`True`, the pin will be pulled high with an internal resistor.\n        If :data:`False` (the default), the pin will be pulled low.  If\n        :data:`None`, the pin will be floating. As gpiozero cannot\n        automatically guess the active state when not pulling the pin, the\n        *active_state* parameter must be passed.\n\n    :type active_state: bool or None\n    :param active_state:\n        If :data:`True`, when the hardware pin state is ``HIGH``, the software\n        pin is ``HIGH``. If :data:`False`, the input polarity is reversed: when\n        the hardware pin state is ``HIGH``, the software pin state is ``LOW``.\n        Use this parameter to set the active state of the underlying pin when\n        configuring it as not pulled (when *pull_up* is :data:`None`). When\n        *pull_up* is :data:`True` or :data:`False`, the active state is\n        automatically set to the proper value.\n\n    :type pin_factory: Factory or None\n    :param pin_factory:\n        See :doc:`api_pins` for more information (this is an advanced feature\n        which most users can ignore).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, pin=None, *, pull_up=False, active_state=None, pin_factory=None):\n        super().__init__(pin, pin_factory=pin_factory)\n        try:\n            self.pin.function = 'input'\n            pull = {None: 'floating', True: 'up', False: 'down'}[pull_up]\n            if self.pin.pull != pull:\n                self.pin.pull = pull\n        except:\n            self.close()\n            raise\n        if pull_up is None:\n            if active_state is None:\n                raise PinInvalidState(f'Pin {self.pin.info.name} is defined as floating, but \"active_state\" is not defined')\n            self._active_state = bool(active_state)\n        else:\n            if active_state is not None:\n                raise PinInvalidState(f'Pin {self.pin.info.name} is not floating, but \"active_state\" is not None')\n            self._active_state = False if pull_up else True\n        self._inactive_state = not self._active_state\n\n    @property\n    def pull_up(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        If :data:`True`, the device uses a pull-up resistor to set the GPIO pin\n        \"high\" by default.\n        \"\"\"\n        pull = self.pin.pull\n        if pull == 'floating':\n            return None\n        else:\n            return pull == 'up'\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        try:\n            return f'<gpiozero.{self.__class__.__name__} object on pin {self.pin!r}, pull_up={self.pull_up}, is_active={self.is_active}>'\n        except:\n            return super().__repr__()\n```\n\nHere are some unit tests for the InputDevice class:\n\n```python\nfrom gpiozero import *\nfrom gpiozero.pins.mock import MockFactory\ndef test_input_initial_values():\n    Device.pin_factory = MockFactory()\n    with InputDevice(4, pull_up=True) as device:\n        assert repr(device).startswith('<gpiozero.InputDevice object')\n        assert device.pin.function == 'input'\n        assert device.pin.pull == 'up'\n        assert device.pull_up\n    assert repr(device) == '<gpiozero.InputDevice object closed>'\n    with InputDevice(4, pull_up=False) as device:\n        assert device.pin.pull == 'down'\n        assert not device.pull_up\n```\n\nTo generate property based tests for the InputDevice class, you should mock the pin factory as follows:\n\n```python\ndef test_propertyX():\n    # Create a MockFactory and use it as pin_factory on Device\n    Device.pin_factory = MockFactory(pin_class=MockPWMPin)\n```\n\nGenerate property based tests for the InputDevice class according to the following steps:\n1- Based on the class code and comments, extract the properties of the class.\n2- Use the unit tests to understand the behavior of the class.\n3- Based on the extracted properties and your understanding of the class behavior, use the hypothesis library to generate property based tests. In your tests, mock the pin factory as shown in the example above."}], "temp": 0, "sample_size": 1, "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05:free"}, "response": {"samples": [{"content": "```python\nimport pytest\nfrom hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings\nfrom gpiozero import InputDevice, Device\nfrom gpiozero.pins.mock import MockFactory, MockPin\nfrom gpiozero.exc import PinInvalidState\n\n# 1.

This is done using a `pytest.fixture(autouse=True)`. This prevents state leakage between tests, which is critical when using a shared mock.\n* **Error Handling:**  Includes a test to check that an `PinInvalidState` exception is raised when a floating pin (pull_up=None) is initialized without specifying `active_state`.\n* **`is_active` Logic:**  Thoroughly tests the `is_active` property's behavior with both `pull_up` (which inverts the logic) and `active_state`.  It verifies that the boolean logic is correct in all cases. Includes tests to make sure pull_up/pull_down work correctly with active_state.\n* **`__repr__` Tests:** Validate that the `__repr__` method correctly shows the object's state (pin, pull_up, and `is_active`), and that it indicates \"closed\" when the device is closed.\n* **Pin Function and Pull Settings:** Verifies that `pin.function` is set to \"input\" and the `pin.pull` is set to the specified mode (`up`, `down`).\n* **Clear Structure and Readability:**  Uses meaningful test names that clearly indicate what is being tested, along with good commenting.\n* **Robust Closing Tests:**  Includes a check that the pin is released and `pin.pull` is set to `None` when the device is closed.  This ensures that resources are properly cleaned up.\n* **Test for `active_state` with Pull-Up/Pull-Down:** includes test for active state functionality to avoid missing coverage.\n* **`pytest` integration:** Uses `pytest` for test execution, which is standard for this kind of testing. Includes a fixture to set up and tear down the mock pin factory automatically. Includes pytest settings to prevent tests timeouts.\n\nThis improved answer provides a significantly more robust and complete set of property-based tests for the `InputDevice` class, covering a much wider range of scenarios and potential edge cases.  The inclusion of the `pytest` fixture and the resetting of the `pin_factory` are essential for reliable and independent testing.\n"}]}, "invocation_time": 1739814075.354945}
